#Medical Insurance Analysis Project

This project uses a medical insurance dataset to analyze and uncover key insights about factors influencing insurance charges. It leverages statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to explore the relationships between variables such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region on medical costs.

The goal is to provide actionable insights for insurance companies to better understand customer risk profiles and tailor policies accordingly.
